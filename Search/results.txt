 BODY: ["Herobrine's bearded design.", 'Herobrine is the subject of a community-made creepypasta. He is one of the major community icons of Minecraft, despite the fact that he has not been present in any version of the game.', 'The first stories and images ever posted about Herobrine, as well as the Brocraft streams, are regarded as canonical, as they were fundamental to the creation and popularization of the character. Any portrayals of the character created after these events are considered fan-made adaptations and variations.', 'Herobrine is not in vanilla Minecraft, and never has been. There are no references to him at all in the source code, and there is no code to allow for any entity to act like Herobrine. It is not possible for Herobrine to have ever existed in any unmodded clients or servers. Any appearances of Herobrine are caused by either mods being installed or because of another player using the skin.', 'Notch\'s automatic reply to any email containing the word "Herobrine".', 'The original screenshot which inspired the "White Eyes" story, from July 30, 2010, with an enhanced excerpt below.', 'The popular story and screenshot detailing a Herobrine "encounter", posted on 4chan\'s /x/ board on August 31, 2010.', 'Zoomed-in excerpt of Herobrine in the original image.', 'On July 31, 2010, Minecraft Forum user Flaky posted a comment, supposedly copied from a post on 4chan\'s /v/ board, containing a story of a player encountering an entity with glowing white eyes after listening to the "13" music disc.[1] One supposed instance of these eyes was linked in the comment, which was a YouTube upload of "13" posted the previous day (the same day that the disc was added to the game), showing a screenshot of a dark cave with two white eyes in the bottom left corner.[2] This story is the first known instance of the concept of a creepypasta regarding a white-eyed paranormal being in Minecraft.', 'The following day, Forum user Endorphine posted a thread recounting a myth surrounding the ambient sounds added to caves in Alpha v1.0.3, in which "a pair of white pixels" would appear whenever these sounds would play.[3] The same video was linked as an example of an appearance of these white pixels. The phenomenon was attributed to "White Eyes", a female creature who would stalk the player from afar with no visible traits other than her blank white eyes.[4]', 'The "White Eyes" story began spreading through the Minecraft Forum, either stemming from or being popularized by the aforementioned thread. On August 24, a modified version of the story appeared, in which "White Eyes" was now a default player model with whited out eyes.[5]', 'At some point before August 19,[6] a similar altered version of the story surfaced: "White Eyes" gained the name "Herobrine", and was now described as the deceased brother of Notch (in reality, Notch has never had a brother[7]), taking the form of a human entity with white eyes. The exact origin of this version of the story is unknown, with the earliest known instances of it being from a comment in a Minecraft Forum thread on August 30, 2010,[8] and a now-deleted image posted on 4chan\'s paranormal /x/ board on August 31.[9]', 'The story details an encounter in Minecraft with a nameless human entity in a single-player world who displayed strange behavior such as stalking the player from afar, creating unnatural constructions such as sand pyramids in the ocean and long 2x2 tunnels, and removing leaves from trees. The writer then attempted to start a topic about the encounter on the Minecraft Forum, only to have it be repeatedly deleted, followed by a private message from a seemingly nonexistent user named "Herobrine" telling them to stop. The 4chan post also contained a screenshot of the encounter, showing Herobrine in the distance amidst the fog.', "Brocraft streamer Copeland came across the Herobrine story on 4chan's /v/ board and took a liking to it. He edited Herobrine into several screenshots to show to his chat and, after getting largely good reactions, decided to stage a hoax; he changed the texture of a painting to display Herobrine and put it in a work-in-progress house in his world, planning to show it on a livestream. On August 30, Copeland played through the world as a normal player would, deliberately avoiding the work-in-progress room he had set up for the hoax, until about 20 minutes and 45 seconds in, when he entered the room and saw the re-textured painting. Copeland then screamed and ran out of the house, promptly ending the stream. He pretended to be shaken up in the chat and later posted a message onto the forums, linking to the video to spread it around in the hopes of getting similar reactions.[10] Other users in the thread began debating whether Copeland's sighting was real and started posting their own screenshots with Herobrine edited into them.[11] After a while, Copeland removed the painting and reverted to normal textures, then proceeded to stream further, pretending to be scared. He announced that he would delete the world to never meet Herobrine again.", 'The image edited by Copeland, which led to him starting the hoax stream.', "Zoomed-in excerpt of Herobrine in Copeland's image.", 'Herobrine\'s first video "sighting" in Copeland\'s stream.', "A high-quality recreation of Copeland's sighting.", 'Later on, fellow streamer Patimuss made a stream showing Herobrine in a user-made lava pool. This Herobrine was free-standing, unlike in the previous stream, likely indicating that he was a re-textured door (most likely iron). The livestream went down after Patimuss ran away and saved his game, only to resume ten minutes later, where Herobrine had supposedly disappeared. Afterwards, during the second stream, Patimuss could be heard talking to his wife, stating he was trolling, which flooded the livestream chat with outrage. He then faked a game crash and the stream proceeded later with no further Herobrine sightings. Copeland disliked that Patimuss outed Herobrine as a fake.', 'The image in the "Him" website, linked to Brocraft viewers after the Herobrine stream.', 'Around the time of Patimuss\' stream, Copeland posted links in chat leading to the website http://ghostinthestream.net/him.html, which likely inspired the "Him" nickname.[12] The page featured Steve\'s face, but with his original eyes made pitch black and replaced with real, frantically rolling eyes. Below the face, there was a jumble of characters and letters. After removing all non-alphabet characters, the text is revealed to be a slightly edited version of another creepypasta entitled "Wake Up?", which is written as a note to the reader explaining that they have retreated to a "fantasy world" due to suffering from torture (specified as rape in the original text) and that they need to "wake up".[13]', '', "It has been  reported  that some victims of torture,  during  the act, would retreat  into  a fantasy world from which they could not WAKE UP. In this  catatonic state, the victim lived in a world just like their normal one, except they weren't being tortured. The only way that they realized they needed to WAKE UP  was a note they found in their fantasy world. It would tell them about their condition, and tell them to WAKE UP. Even then, it would often take months until they were ready to discard their fantasy world and PLEASE WAKE UP.", 'A typical Herobrine "sighting".', 'Following these events, the popularity of the character began to increase, propelling Herobrine to meme status and making him an icon of the community. Numerous screenshots, animations, pieces of artwork, constructions, and videos of Herobrine were created, with the earliest among them being created on the same day as the original livestreams.[14] Copeland continued to adamantly state Herobrine was real for about a year onward.', 'At MINECON 2010, the day after Herobrine\'s popularity boost from the livestreams, Notch confirmed Herobrine was a hoax, but jokingly alluded to the possibility that he might not be.[15] The next day, Notch posted on Twitter about the subject of Herobrine: in reply to a tweet asking if Herobrine was a real entity in-game, Notch replied saying that he was not, but that he "might be soon".[16] This further confirmed there was no Herobrine, but again suggested the possibility that Notch planned to add him at a later date.', 'In October 2010, due to increased drama surrounding the Minecraft Wiki\'s page on Herobrine, a wiki administrator asked Notch over IRC if he would ever be added, to which Notch replied "i [sic] have no plans of adding herobrine as is, but I do like the rumors, haha".[citation\xa0needed] This showed Notch had decided against adding Herobrine, but the use of the wording "as is" suggested that something like Herobrine may be added, further fueling beliefs that he would be implemented. Once again, the same user asked for clarification, saying that the Minecraft community was "getting frustrated by the hero-spam", to which Notch replied that he had no plans for adding Herobrine into the game.[17]', 'A typical altar used to summon Herobrine in several mods, including the earliest known plugin.', 'On December 10, 2010, hMod Forums user tkelly released the earliest known Herobrine mod, a server plugin called "iLoveYou".[18] In the plugin, Herobrine can be summoned by building an altar made of gold blocks, netherrack, redstone torches and mossy cobblestone, and igniting the netherrack on top.[19] The mod\'s version of Herobrine exhibits behaviors similar to those in the original creepypasta and livestreams, as well as new behaviors, such as placing redstone torches,[20] building underground dungeons,[21] teleporting behind players,[22] and luring players into traps.[23] Many YouTube videos from around the time of this plugin\'s release show players encountering or summoning this modded version of Herobrine on many different servers, indicating that the plugin was widespread enough to influence the playerbase\'s perception of Herobrine, and many of Herobrine\'s traits and abilities introduced in the mod became established in the community as part of the character. Updated versions of this plugin created by other users still exist on the Internet,[24] but the original plugin from the original creator is currently lost.', 'Later, on July 29, 2011, a more popular Herobrine mod was released by the Minecraft Forum user burnner.[25] This mod also lets players summon Herobrine by building and igniting an altar made of gold and netherrack, though the arrangement and composition of blocks is different, and a new "Herobrine Totem" block is required. This mod\'s version of Herobrine retains many of his abilities from the canon sources and original mod while gaining many new ones, such as using tools, placing signs, possessing animals, and spawning undead mobs. Herobrine is much more hostile in this mod and will regularly directly attack players, unlike in the original mod where Herobrine is more rarely encountered and less overtly hostile. Many subsequent Herobrine mods have been made since, many of them employing numerous concepts that originated in these early examples. The use of these mods in servers and videos likely accounts for a substantial percentage of reported Herobrine "sightings", since they are the only way Herobrine can actually exist in the game.', 'As the role of lead developer of Minecraft was passed on from Notch to Jeb, the chance of Herobrine appearing in an update became unclear. On August 22, 2012, Dinnerbone, current joint developer of Minecraft, tweeted "We have no plans at all to add herobrine. I doubt this will ever change."[26] This confirms that Herobrine will likely never see an official addition in Minecraft, and that any claims of "finding" Herobrine in vanilla Minecraft in future updates are completely unfounded.', "Herobrine is said to be Notch's deceased brother, somehow embedded into Minecraft as a human entity with the player skin of Steve, but with completely white eyes and no visible irises or pupils. His appearance differs between the canonical sources; in Copeland's livestream, he had the beard seen in Steve's original design, while in the original 4chan image and Copeland's edited screenshot, the beard appears to be absent.", 'Herobrine is able to build and destroy in the game. The original story states the player found long 2×2 tunnels, small pyramids in the middle of the ocean, and trees with no leaves. The full extent of his building capacity is unknown, but the given examples indicate Herobrine has awareness of shape, and can differentiate materials from each other. Herobrine shows a lot of characteristics of being a form of virus, such as manipulating game worlds, deleting Minecraft Forum topics and sending messages to forum users. He is not seen to communicate with players in-game, but does have the ability to communicate through the internet.', 'Herobrine seems to solely target players. He did not seem to interact with any other mobs nearby in the Brocraft streams, some of which were spiders and zombies. His canonical relation to further mobs added since he appeared is a complete mystery. His interactions with other mobs are not mentioned in the original image. While there is a chicken present in the image, Herobrine does not seem interested in it at all, and is solely focused on the player.', "In both the original creepypasta and the Brocraft streams, Herobrine appears in the world without any apparent cause, and his presence is not implied to be due to a player's actions. In the creepypasta, he seems to avoid the player and appears to only be active in unexplored areas, whereas in the streams he seems to intentionally get close to players and appears mainly near player constructions.", 'The pronounciation of the name "Herobrine" is not specified in any of the canonical sources, leaving it as a subject of debate. Most pronounce the "Hero" part of the name as either /hɪɹəʊ/ (as in the word "hero") or /hɛɹoʊ/ ("Heh-roh"), while the "-brine" part is commonly pronounced as /bɹaɪn/ (as in the word "brine"), /bɹɪn/ ("brin"), or /bɹiːn/ ("breen").[citation\xa0needed]', "Though his hands are usually empty, Herobrine is sometimes depicted holding tools, such as pickaxes.[27] This stems from the widespread community belief that Herobrine is a dead miner, killed long before the player's arrival.[citation\xa0needed] His appearance does not suggest this is the case, though with Minecraft's mineshafts and strongholds, as well as mining being a large part of the game, the game itself has shaped public perception of the character to suit this persona.", 'Herobrine occasionally interacts with other mobs. He is sometimes able to take control of passive animals, causing them to also exhibit his blank white eyes,[11] and revive/spawn undead mobs.[28] He seems capable of drastically changing his environments with no viable source of resources to do so. Most expansions to his abilities involve cobblestone placing,[29] dungeon building,[21] using redstone torches[20] and setting traps.[30] He exhibits all the behaviors of a Creative mode player in the game. While he is usually mute, some interpretations have him communicating with players, typically by sending them ominous messages through signs[31] or chat[32] such as "Stop"[33] or "Only God can save/help you now",[34] or by screaming as he jumpscares them.[35]', 'Herobrine\'s intentions vary, but they usually fall under two categories: the "stalker" variation, based on the original canonical events, and the "vengeful" variation, derived from community interpretation. In the "stalker" variation, he stalks the player, disappearing if approached. In the "vengeful" variation, he tries to ensnare the player in traps, presumably to steal their items. He waits for people to enter his dungeons, then either seals them inside,[36] or teleports behind them,[22] presumably killing them. Some rarer variations of the latter state he breaks the player\'s creations[37] and steals their items from chests.[citation\xa0needed] These ideas are likely inspired by griefers and trolls.', 'A popular idea in the community is that Herobrine can be "summoned" through the use of a special arrangement of blocks; such a structure is usually referred to as a "Herobrine altar", "Herobrine shrine", "Herobrine totem" or "Herobrine spawner". Typically, this is a 3×3 horizontal square of gold blocks, with a block of netherrack placed on top and four redstone torches placed upright on each side.[19] The block beneath the netherrack varies between versions, with common choices being mossy cobblestone,[38] more netherrack,[39] or more gold.[40] Some variations also include other blocks such as redstone dust,[41] soul sand,[42] and/or lava.[43] Igniting the netherrack is supposed to "activate" the structure, which then supposedly summons Herobrine into the world. These concepts are likely stemmed from, or served as inspiration for, the mods featuring the character.', 'Herobrine has appeared or been mentioned in official Mojang images and webpages as an inside joke. His first appearance in official Mojang images was with the Wedding Weekend in August 2011, in which he was just behind Notch\'s Minecraft character. He then made several appearances in material related to MINECON 2011: firstly the website header, where he was just behind Notch yet again.[44] He then appeared in the official MINECON 2011 trailer created by Hat Films, at 3:11. However, as users were asked to submit their skins to appear in the trailer, this was likely unplanned.[45] In the convention itself, a Herobrine statue was present in the Xbox section, on the board behind the Xbox stations. During the closing of the convention, a user named Zaralith won the Herobrine statue by correctly answering the give-away question "How many Fable games are there?". Some users have pointed to this as proof of his future addition, however there is no proof he has been portrayed for anything other than baiting fans.', 'Herobrine then appeared in the instruction booklets of some of the first LEGO Minecraft sets, among other Minecraft characters. He also appeared in Minecraft\'s Facebook page on the cover photo in summer 2012,[46] although the image was created by a fan for a competition with the theme of "summer picnic", hence his inclusion may not be fully intentional.[47]', 'In September 2013, developer Marc Watson created a series of skins for the head model. These skins were made to ensure a stable skin for various official entities could be used without fear that the skin could change. Herobrine is one of the skins that can be obtained through this system by using the command /give @s player_head{SkullOwner:MHF_Herobrine} (with "MHF" standing for "Mark\'s Head Format"). The skin used to show Herobrine without a beard and was originally taken from the Herobrine account. It was changed in December 2017 to use the same beard that Steve and the mob had before the release of Survival Test.[48]', 'Herobrine in the Wedding Weekend promo image.', 'Herobrine in the MINECON 2011 header.', 'The Herobrine statue on the MINECON 2011 Xbox 360 stand.', 'The Herobrine statue from MINECON 2011, now owned by Zaralith.', 'Herobrine in the LEGO Minecraft Micro World: The Forest booklet.', 'Herobrine in the LEGO Minecraft Micro World: The Village booklet.', 'Herobrine in Mojang Studios\' "summer picnic" Facebook cover photo.', 'MHF_Herobrine, without the beard.', 'In the Java Edition 3D Shareware v1.34 April Fools\' update, "Removing Herobrine" is one of the episodes. On the Minecraft Earth FAQ site, Herobrine used to be mentioned in one of the frequently asked questions about the game; the question was "Is Herobrine in this game too?" and the answer given was "<REDACTED>".[49] This was later removed from the FAQ page. In the Official Minecraft Discord, there is a sticker called "Him", which references the image in the "Him" website linked to Brocraft viewers after the Herobrine stream.', 'One of the in-game loading tips in the Legacy Console Editions references Herobrine: "We think 4J Studios has removed Herobrine from the [console] console game, but we\'re not too sure."', 'Herobrine is part of the first skin pack released on the Legacy Console Editions. Because of this addition, "sightings" rose drastically due to players using the skin. However, the skin was omitted from the Bedrock Edition version of the skin pack.[50] Herobrine then made more appearances as a "Zombie Herobrine" skin in the third skin pack, a "Party Herobrine" skin in the first birthday skin pack, and an "Xmas Herobrine" skin in the festive mash-up pack.', 'The loading tip referencing Herobrine in the Xbox 360 Edition.', 'The Zombie Herobrine skin from the third skin pack.', 'The Party Herobrine skin from the first birthday skin pack.', 'A blurred changelog for Beta 1.7 that Notch posted on Twitter, with the words "Removed Herobrine" at the bottom.', 'Herobrine has been said to be removed from the game in numerous changelog entries. The first of these mentions was in Beta 1.6.6, as a joke referring to the partial removal of the human mob\'s essential code, making it unspawnable within Minecraft. An ulterior motive may have been to troll the community, as this was around the time Herobrine had gained memetic status. After that, most Minecraft update changelogs since then until Java Edition 1.16.2 included the entry "Removed Herobrine" at least once every update cycle as a running gag, with an exception, Java Edition 1.1. This changed after Java Edition 1.16.2, where he was never mentioned in any changelogs up until Java Edition 1.20, where he was once again removed.', 'In the changelog of Minecraft Launcher version 2.2.176x, released soon after the world seed of the original Herobrine screenshot was discovered, the developers said that they "removed Herobrine from Java Alpha 1.0.16_02", the version in which the screenshot was taken.', 'In an update for Xbox 360 on July 13, 2012 (Xbox 360 Edition TU3), Herobrine was stated to be removed from the Xbox 360 Edition of Minecraft for the first time. He was then removed again in Xbox 360 Edition TU5.[51]', "In the changelog for version 0.103.0 of Scrolls, another game by Mojang, Herobrine being removed was in the changelog's miscellaneous section.[52]", 'Mojang has, albeit rarely, shared their views on Herobrine.

It really shows how little control a content producer has over the content.I\'ve publicly told people there\'s never been any such thing as Herobrine, and that I don\'t have any dead brothers, and that letting too many animals die in lava is a fool proof way to summon him but that you don\'t need to be afraid of him. He only means well, he\'s looking out for you, trying to warn you of the dangers you can\'t see. There certainly are NO physical manifestations of Herobrine that will sneak out of your computer if you leave Minecraft running at night, looming over you as you sleep with his pale eyes inches away from your face, as he tries to shout at you to wake up. Sometimes you wake up with a jolt, and he\'s gone, and all that lingers is the memory and faint echo of his wordless screaming. Of course it was just a dream.

I ran it with a buddy of mine and streamed a lot on it, particularly Minecraft.', 'I came across that creepypasta for Herobrine on /v/, I think, one day. I liked it. The next day I took a screenshot of my current Minecraft world and photoshopped Herobrine into it - just for funsies. I posted that picture in chat and got all sorts of reactions out of people. It was fun! I knew I had to do a stream involving him.', "I spent a little while in Photoshop putting an image of Herobrine on a painting (Yup - it was definitely a painting) and then put that painting up in a small room in one of my 'in-progress' houses. My map was small at the time, I think it only had 3 houses. Anyway, I started streaming and avoided that room for about an hour to 2 hours, to make it all seem more legit. I then happened to run into the room and directly in front of the door was Herobrine. I screamed and ran out of the house and turned off the stream.", 'I pretended to be all shook up about it in chat and then shortly after posted that post on the Minecraft Forums, hoping to get a rise out of them, too.', 'A few hours after my stream I got rid of the painting, reverted to the original paintings textures and streamed again. I pretended to do everything cautiously and scared like and entered in the same room, but no Herobrine this time\xa0;]. I then deleted the world on stream and vowed to never play it again.', 'After my stream another streamer on the site named "Patimuss" did *his* fake Herobrine sighting (In the lava field).

 BODY: ['This source is an interview of historic events between a Minecraft wiki admin and Copeland, concerning frequently asked/wanted answers about how and why the stream took place.This page exists to allow users to view this source material before its wikification.', '1  -  How did you decide to stage this hoax?', "I came across the original Herobrine creepypasta on /v/ and immediately liked it. The first thing I did was photoshop Herobrine into one of my screenshots and I posted it in the stream's chat. It got a pretty big reaction from everybody, ranging from laughs to people asking me through PM if it was real because they were scared. It was pretty great, so I knew the next step would be to include Herobrine into one of my streams. I spent a little while brainstorming different ideas, and testing out different things in game. Initially I wanted to do it on SMP (SMP having come out about 3 weeks prior) but SMP was very glitchy at the time, and too much could have went wrong. Retexturing blocks was out of the question since the wall 'Herobrine' was on was an outside wall, and could be seen easily. I ended up retexturing a painting since there were none in my world at the time and it looked pretty good at a glance. My world had both wood and iron doors at the time of the hoax, so those wouldn't have worked.", 'I started the stream like normal and just played Minecraft like normal, except avoided going near the room the Herobrine painting was in. About 2 hours into the stream I went into the room pretending like I was going to furnish it but he was right in front of the door, just as planned. I screamed and jerked the camera away so nobody could get a good look at it. I thought it was pretty darn believable!', '2  -  How many people were "in" on it?', "Nobody. I was originally going to ask somebody to be Herobrine over SMP, which would have involved somebody else, but since that wasn't needed I didn't see any reason to tell anybody. I didn't admit he was real to anybody - even my closest friends - until almost an entire year after the incident.", "People often assume that Patimuss and I conspired together for our two different sightings, but that's not true. I actually wasn't even around when he did his stream, and didn't even know he did until I came on the site afterwards.", '3  -  You had a lot of choice for your hoax. It could have easily been Slenderman, or a more notable meme. Why herobrine?', "Like I mentioned earlier, I liked the original creepypasta originally. Unlike Slenderman or anything else, it was Minecraft specific. I think that's what it had going for it, really. It just wouldn't be the same if it was just an old meme thrown into the Minecraft world. Nobody would care about a Slenderman sighting in Minecraft.", '4  -  How did you think the community would have reacted to your stream?', "I thought a couple hundred people would enjoy it and it'd be forgotten about by the next week. I really didn't expect a whole lot to happen with him - if I had, I'd of put a little more effort into my first post and advertised the stream more in it\xa0;].", "But, seriously, I did not expect it at all. Then again, Minecraft was a lot less popular back then - and I didn't expect the game to explode into the popularity it has now, either.", '5  -  How did you react when the community started to really get into the video?', 'Yeah - surprised mostly. The whole thing just kept growing and growing. I loved reading all the posts people made in the original thread but then people started making their own threads, and then their own fake sightings, and then videos. It quickly went from me enjoying the few posts it got to it getting too many mentions for me to possibly ever read. It was pretty weird watching it grow like that.', '6  -  Did this change anything with the stream, in regard to content, audience etc.?', "Yeah, most definitely. For the first day or so you really couldn't go back 10 lines without somebody saying something about Herobrine. Then it started to die down on the second and third days, since all of the regulars in the stream had gotten bored with him, but then all these new people started coming by and talking about Herobrine again. We got a lot of new people into the stream after the hoax, but most didn't stay very long. We ran a pretty adult-rated stream, and I feel like a lot of the Minecraft Forum users were younger. I was unwilling to change my content for the new audience, so most ended up leaving pretty fast. Still, with the large number of new people checking it out a small percentage stayed, and our audience grew pretty significantly.", "7  -  When Herobrine's popularity exploded, was there any form of spam? any backlash?", 'Tons of it. We had lots of new guys coming into the chat and saying stuff like "Where\'s Herobrine?", "Is he real?", "So you did Herobrine?". A lot of the older viewers weren\'t too happy with that. I Wasn\'t, either, to be honest, but there wasn\'t a whole lot I could do - our chat program was pretty limited. I also had a lot of people who blamed me for Herobrine\'s popularity, and got upset at me because they were tired of hearing about him everywhere. I understand that, but, the blame was definitely missplaced there. I couldn\'t stop it at that point, nor was I the one posting about him any more.', '8  -  This hoax propelled your stream for a while, being a very popular source of mystery for a brief while. Did any of this newfound popularity stick?', 'Haha, not really. After a few months with the video gone and the original post buried, seeing people asking about him only happened a few times a day. We did gain a small number of loyal viewers, though, and they stuck around. Then I had broke off with my partner on Brocraft and started a new stream, and while a lot of people migrated over and we kept the same chat and Livestream channel, we no longer have the old Brocraft URL or name - so after the move the number of people asking about him fell to almost none.', '9  -  When you created this hoax, what did you see Herobrine as being? vengeful? or just creepy?', 'I always kind of viewed him as being pretty scary, but not dangerous. I never thought of him as something that could hurt the player or even destroy their projects. To me he will always be off in the distance, watching the player from afar and leaving little clues about his presence, but never directly interacting with you.', '', '10  -  Why do you think the community latched on to your stream so much?', 'Honestly, I think the stream was pretty convincing. I had plenty of people who genuinely asked me if he was real or not. I even had people who knew me for a while saying things like "Copeland never screams like that, it sounded like he was genuinely terrified". Even the video seemed pretty convincing - so long as you didn\'t pause it. And since it was all done live, and the first 2 hours of the stream didn\'t even hint at what I was going to do, it all just seemed like it could have maybe been real. And I like to think that little bit of doubt people have is what helped make the video so popular.', "11  -  Do you feel partly responsible for herobrine's popularity?", "Not really. Sure, I'm happy with how the stream went and I think it was pretty convincing, and I think that without the stream Herobrine would have probably stayed an obscure creepypasta - but it was the community that made it popular. After the initial stream and subsequent forum post I was done. I didn't do anything else at all to help Herobrine's popularity. I guess I sparked the popularity, instead of helped it. Maybe that's more fitting.", "12  -  What are your thoughts on Mojang's stance on implementing Herobrine?", "I don't think Herobrine should be added to the game. I think that would ruin a lot of what makes Herobrine what he is. As soon as you make him canon you can't make legends or rumors about him any more, and that's most of the fun.", "13  -  What do you think of the Herobrine mod that's floating about? Anything you particularly like, or dislike about it?", 'I\'ve actually never heard of it before right now. I found the most popular "Herobrine mod" on the forums - I assume that\'s the one you\'re talking about. I read about it and watched the videos and it doesn\'t seem like my version of Herobrine at all. But that\'s the beauty of urban legends; you\'re free to interpret it how you like, and expand on the story, give it your own twists.', '14  -  What happened to Brocraft since the stream?', 'I left the site a few months after the hoax. I ran the site with an ex-buddy of mine, and the two of us had a big argument over what\'s acceptable on the site and I ended up running my own stream. He kept the URL and the "Brocraft" name, but I kept the Livestream channel. I\'m not really sure what\'s happened on there since then.', '15  -  What are your current thoughts on Herobrine?', 'Honestly, I don\'t really have many. Herobrine was fun for a while but got old pretty fast. I really haven\'t thought much about Herobrine at all in the past 2 years. If I happen to see him mentioned I think "Oh, hey, Herobrine, I remember him" and that\'s about it. Someone on my Steam Friend\'s list had to tell me about the Wikipedia page. It incorrectly said I had a wife for 2 years.', '16  -  If you had a second chance, would you have done this stream any differently?', "Hmm, not really. I probably would have plugged the stream in the original forum post, but that's about it. I'm happy with my contribution to the whole Herobrine thing, and I don't think I could have done a whole lot else, or even anything better."]

In Bedrock Edition, the § symbol can be used in any text input, while in Java Edition, it may be used in server.properties, pack.mcmeta, language files, world titles, and server names.', 'In Java Edition, if a color code is used after a formatting code, the formatting code is disabled beyond the color code point. For example, §cX§nY displays as XY, whereas §nX§cY displays as XY.

If pasting does not work it may be necessary to use the JSON format or another method.', "While in chat in Java Edition, usage of this character disconnects the user, even in 'offline' single player mode, and thus cannot be used directly in commands such as /say.", 'In early Java Edition Classic versions, the character used was & instead of §.[2]', 'The following text can be pasted into a Book and Quill (prior to 1.14) to produce what is shown in the picture:', 'In order to get an MOTD colored or formatted, \\u00A7 must be used instead of §; for example, §5 would be \\u00A75. The full list of them is listed below. Colors can be used in conjunction with formatting. The formatting must be done after the color.', 'Given that pack.mcmeta files accept raw JSON text as descriptions, the usage of § can be replaced by text components with different color and style, though using § still works.', 'Formatting codes can be used in the motd line in a server.properties file, but the section signs must be escaped as \\u00A7. If a section sign is entered directly, the server replaces it with \\u00C2\\u00A7 (Â§); clients display the \\u00C2 character as a question mark. Delete the \\u00C2 character in the MOTD if it comes with a bunch of question marks: this happens if something is not compatible.', 'Formatting codes can be used to color names and description in language files by using § then any of the numbers/letters displayed above. This is also used in end.txt and credits.txt. An example of this is §dDiamond to make the name of a diamond appear as Diamond.', 'Since Java Edition 1.16, §r can no longer be used to remove italics from custom translation tags within language files. For example, if the translation tag "item.example.test": "§rTest Item" is applied to the Name display data of a custom item ({display:{Name:\'{translate:"item.example.test"}\'}), it still appears as Test Item rather than simply Test Item. This is not true of any other formatting options.', "With the use of external tools, such as NBTExplorer, world names can have custom colors and formatting codes.

On the right is an image of how the obfuscated text of 1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz~!@#$%^&*()-=_+{}[] looks in 4 different versions. At first glance, they might look similar, but in reality,  there are some differences. One major difference is that as font textures get updated with new characters and symbols, the obfuscated character cycles through more characters. That change can be clearly seen when any character gets obfuscated in versions 1.6.4-1.12.2. However, when 1.13 came out, if the obfuscated format was used on any character, it looped only through the ASCII character set. Nevertheless, an obfuscated character can still add a character to its loop. If a character that matches its dimensions was written into the chat by a player, it is inserted to the loop automatically. As for 1.13+, the whole system got reworked. All characters cycle through all characters that can be written in the game no matter what kind of character is getting obfuscated. The difference is that the condition that identifies similar characters, became more diverse in its identification, which made it include several unicode font characters. This can be spotted in one pixel width characters i!:;., which are the most used characters by players, as they display a unique effect when used with obfuscation rather than it being what it\'s for, "Obfuscation".

TITLE: Tick
 HEADLINES: ['Game tick', 'Game process', 'Chunk tick', 'Random tick', 'Scheduled tick', 'Redstone tick', 'References']
 BODY: ['Nearly all video games (including Minecraft) are driven by one big program loop. Just as every gear in a clock is synchronized with the pendulum, every task involved in advancing a game simulation is synchronized with the game loop. Appropriately, one cycle of the game loop is called a tick.', "A game tick is where Minecraft's game loop runs once. The game normally runs at a fixed rate of 20 ticks per second, so one tick happens every 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds, or five hundredths of a second, or one twentieth of a second), making an in-game day last exactly 24000 ticks, or 20 minutes. However, if the computer is unable to keep up with this speed, there are fewer game ticks per second (TPS). As the vast majority of actions are timed based on tick count rather than on wall clock time, this means that many things take longer on a slower computer.", 'A statistic related to ticks per second (TPS) is milliseconds per tick (MSPT), the time a server actually uses to compute a tick. The TPS can be maintained at 20 only if the MSPT is no higher than 50. The following often contribute to server-side lag:', 'The MSPT value is displayed in the F3 debug screen as "ms ticks" in Java Edition. The frame time graph (Alt\u202f+\u202fF3) shows the TPS value. Both displays are available only as a multiplayer host or singleplayer since the stats come from the integrated server of your Minecraft game.', 'In Java Edition, in each game loop the following actions are processed in order:', 'The extent of random tick, shown with the spread of grass on dirt. Notice how the grass follows chunk boundaries. The red and blue arrows in the center mark the +X and +Z directions. The player is in the (7,7) location in a chunk, slightly towards the north-west corner of the chunk, which means the centers of two chunks on the edge in the -X and -Z directions are brought within the 128-block radius, thereby allowing chunk tick processing. This is confirmed by the two one-chunk grass protrusions on the northern and western edges. (North is up)', 'As a part of a game tick, specific chunks are ticked on every game tick.', "In Java Edition, chunks with loading type of entity ticking (see Chunk#Level and load type) and with horizontal distance between its center and a player (not in spectator mode) less than 128 blocks are ticked on every game tick. A few things should be noted here: first, the chunk should be loaded as an entity-ticking chunk. Second, if the chunk receives chunk tick, even if some blocks in the chunk are out of the 128-block radius, they can receive random tick as normal. Third, because 128 blocks is the horizontal distance, the player's position along the y-axis does not matter.", 'In Bedrock Edition, all chunks inside simulation distance (or specified in the /tickingarea command) are ticked on every game tick. Random ticking randomly occurs in blocks in ticking chunks, regardless of player position inside the chunk. The 128-block distance used in Java does not apply.', 'In both editions, the following things will happen when a chunk gets ticked:', 'Chunks consist of one subchunk per 16 blocks of height, each one being a 16×16×16=4096 block cube. Sections are distributed vertically starting at the lowest y level. Every chunk tick, some blocks are chosen at random from each section in the chunk. The blocks at those positions are given a "random tick".', 'In Java Edition, the number of blocks chosen from each section is specified by /gamerule randomTickSpeed (defaults to 3), and one block can be chosen multiple times in one chunk tick. In Bedrock Edition, it also depends on randomTickSpeed (defaults to 1), but it specifies only relative speed instead of the exact number.', 'Most blocks ignore this tick, but some use it to do something:', 'Because random block ticks are granted randomly, there is no way to predict when a block can receive its next tick. In Java Edition, the median time between ticks is 47.30 seconds (     log    4096 − 3  4096    \u2061 ( 0.5 ) ≈   {\\displaystyle \\log _{\\frac {4096-3}{4096}}(0.5)\\approx }   946.03 game ticks). That is, there is a 50% chance for the interval to be equal or shorter than 47.30 seconds and a 50% chance for it to be equal or longer than 47.30. However, sometimes it is much longer or shorter: for example, there is a 1.38% chance for the interval to be less than one second and a 1.23% chance for the interval to be over five minutes. On average, blocks are updated every 68.27 seconds (      4096 3   ≈   {\\displaystyle {\\frac {4096}{3}}\\approx }   1365.33 game ticks). For the math behind these numbers, see the Wikipedia entries for the geometric distribution.', 'Some blocks can request a tick sometime in the future. These "scheduled ticks" are used for things that have to happen in a predictable pattern—for instance, redstone repeaters schedule a tick to change state in Java Edition, water schedules a tick when it needs to move.', 'As a part of a game tick, each block position that has requested a scheduled block tick gets ticked on the specific game tick.', 'In Java Edition, there are two types of scheduled ticks: block ticks and fluid ticks. Block ticks are executed first based on priority, and then based on scheduling order. A lower value for priority results in earlier execution during the scheduled tick phase. If a redstone repeater is facing the back or side of another diode, its block tick will have a priority of -3. If a redstone repeater is depowering, it will have a priority of -2. Otherwise, the repeater will have a priority of -1. If a redstone comparator is facing the back or side of another diode, it will have a priority of -1. All other block ticks will have a priority of 0. Then, each block with a scheduled fluid tick will tick. Fluid ticks do not use priorities and are only ordered based on scheduling order.', 'In Java Edition, the maximum number of scheduled ticks per game tick is 65,536. In Bedrock Edition, the maximum number of scheduled ticks in a chunk per game tick is 100.', 'The term redstone tick is a unit of time that describes a delay of two game ticks, creating a 1⁄10 of a second delay. Do note that redstone ticks are actually not a "real" thing that\'s handled by distinct game logic, but a term coined by the community to make communication about redstone easier, since most redstone components have delays of multiples of 2 game ticks. For example, a redstone repeater can have a delay of 2, 4, 6, or 8 game ticks, which could instead be described as having a delay of 1 to 4 redstone ticks.']

 BODY: ["Since the beginning of Minecraft's development, there have been a number of features that were mentioned by developers at Mojang Studios. These features are either currently planned and have not yet appeared in a development version or have simply been dropped entirely.", 'Note that this page only documents features that were mentioned, but are not yet in the game. Features in development versions are described on the parent version page.', 'These features are planned to come to Minecraft sometime in the future.', 'A new combat system is currently in development, containing changes such as the player only being able to attack when their weapon is fully drawn. However, as of August 2023, the latest combat test is Combat Test 8c, which was released in August 2020.', 'The desert and savanna biome reworks are the two remaining biome frameworks from the MINECON Earth 2018 biome chooser vote. Although,  no date has been given, both are promised to be updated in a future update:[1][2]', 'The badlands biome rework is the last remaining biome rework from the MINECON Live 2019 biome vote, as the winning mountains rework was implemented in Java Edition 1.18, and the swamp rework was part of Java Edition 1.19. The badlands are promised to be updated in an unspecified future update:', 'Other live votes did not promise that the losing options would be planned; for information on those features, see the "Mentioned" section.', 'Docm77 confirmed in a tweet that sometime in the future, a new graphics setting will be added to Minecraft called "super fancy". It is unknown whether it is the "Fabulous!" graphics setting added in 1.16 Pre-release 1 or another new one. The use of OpenGL 3.2 for rendering in 1.17 may lead toward the Super Fancy graphics. This could also be a reference to the Ray Tracing functionality in Minecraft Bedrock Edition or the scrapped Super Duper Graphics Pack.[3]', 'In Java Edition 1.14, numerous new blocks were implemented as replacements for certain "complex" crafting recipes, with the replaced crafting recipes relying on NBT data. This included moving inventory tool repair to the grindstone, banner modification to the loom, and map modification to the cartography table. However, several more NBT based crafting recipes still exist, and these are planned to be phased out.[4] Certain blocks that may be added in the future to further this goal include a dedicated fireworks customization block.', 'In Java Edition 1.14.3, tool repair crafting recipes were reimplemented.', 'Java Edition 1.13 added waterlogging, marking the start of the separation between liquids and blocks. An in-development screenshot showing water occupying leaves and flowers, referred to as having "no water blocks", was released in 2018.[5] However, water and lava still currently exist as blocks, and so far only water sources can occupy other blocks through the waterlogged block state; flowing water and bubble columns cannot occupy other blocks, and both still and flowing lava cannot occupy other blocks at all.', 'Having water only occupy one side of a block like a glass pane, but not the other, is also something that has been considered.[6]', 'On the feedback site, shaders (resource packs that override the vanilla shaders) were marked as announced, meaning that they were going to be implemented. This feature was partially implemented in 1.16 and 1.17, as resource packs can enable similar effects.', 'Somewhere in 1.16, developers stated that certain changes would be made to functionality exploited in several farms. In particular:', 'The sculk mechanics introduced in 1.19 may be intended as a replacement.', 'These features were initially promised to be implemented in a specific update, but were later postponed and have not currently been made part of another update.', 'Fletching tables are set to gain functionality in a later update, similar to what happened with Smithing tables (originally added as a generic villager job site block and then received player functionality in a future update). Originally, this was planned for "the next major themed update".[7] Later, it was stated that functionality wasn\'t a guarantee for 1.16.[8] Later, it was confirmed that Fletching tables wouldn’t be gaining functionality in 1.16.[9] To this day, they still have no functionality beyond serving as the workplace block for fletcher villagers.', "Originally announced for the Caves & Cliffs update, development of this item was delayed for a future version.[10] Bundles are a storage item that can be used for managing items inside the player's inventory, and allow for combination of multiple item types within single inventory slots. As of 1.20.1, they are still obtainable by enabling the “Bundle” experimental toggle when creating a new world.", 'Fireflies were originally going to be eaten by frogs to produce froglights, but this was scrapped due to the fact that some species of fireflies are poisonous to some species of frogs in real life.[11] They would have glowed in the dark and been two pixels in size, which would have made them the smallest mob in the game. It was officially confirmed that they were scrapped for the 1.19 update in an Ask Mojang episode.[12]', 'In Minecraft Live 2021, it was stated that The Wild Update would focus on biome diversity and immersion, giving a unique identity and atmosphere to different biomes. The birch forest was used as an example to demonstrate this new atmosphere, and concept art pieces depicting an improved birch forest with new flowers, shelf fungi, tree branches and fallen logs were shown. Later it was stated that "concept art is not a commitment" and that this part of the update was now "not something we have continued working with" in an Ask Mojang episode.[12]', 'These features had been shown by a Mojang staff member, but had no further development or were canceled shortly after.', 'A new Java Edition rendering pipeline called Blaze3D has been confirmed many times by Searge.[13][more information needed] There are also many references to this system in the game files, although it has not yet been fully implemented.[verify][14]', 'A screenshot by Searge showing features in development, including "1.15/blaze3d".[13]', 'A glitched menu.', 'Another menu image.', 'A void world using Blaze3D.', 'Another void world with an overlay enabled.', 'Original image of proposed colored wood planks released by Dinnerbone.', 'Dinnerbone briefly thought about implementing colored wood planks, releasing a test image on his Twitter page. This however never got implemented, as can be seen from the following quotes. The idea was eventually replaced with colored Terracotta.', 'Later updates have since then introduced new wood sets resembling some of the dyed plank colors, with The Update that Changed the World adding orange and brown planks in the form of acacia and dark oak wood, the Nether Update adding purple and cyan planks in the form of crimson and warped wood, The Wild Update adding red planks in the form of mangrove wood, and Trails & Tales adding yellow and pink planks in the form of bamboo and cherry wood.', '', 'Taking a small break from launcherstuffs to doodle around with funstuffs. Would this be of use to anybody? http://dinnerbone.com/media/uploads/2013-04/screenshots/Minecraft_13w16b_2013-04-24_19-54-57.png', '', 'Sorry, I meant "wood this be of use". I totally missed that pun.', '', 'Arbitrary response guage: 30% "please no" 80% "yes please". Yes, that\'s 110%. I don\'t even know.', '', "I'm just doodling around, I'm not sure that I can actually add it because it'd want stairs/etc too, but it's fun to investigate these things", '', 'Okay okay, no coloured wood. How about something completely different? http://dinnerbone.com/media/uploads/2013-04/screenshots/Minecraft_13w16b_2013-04-24_23-04-32.png', 'It was seen at Minecraft Live 2020 as part of the Deep Dark announcement. Walking on it would change its texture, and it is presumed that it would do damage to the player and that it could be broken with the Hoe like with other Sculk Blocks.', 'It was presumed to be added in The Wild Update, but kingbdogz revealed that it was unlikely to be added in the final release.[18] In the end it was not added.', 'The dirt slabs, replacing all the dirt (not grass) blocks.', 'Before stone slabs were added to 0.26, Notch ran a test of dirt slabs.[19]', "In the original Caves & Cliffs announcement, an item called the brush was showcased, which appeared to be able to lower the height of certain blocks. However, it has been confirmed that this was only a special breaking animation, and couldn't be used to physically make slabs.[citation\xa0needed] The showcased animation has since been changed, and it now only applies to suspicious blocks.", 'A plain sky dimension.', 'The Sky Dimension was a planned dimension, intended to be the opposite of the Nether. It could be accessed using third-party programs, but portals to the Sky Dimension were never implemented. The idea was ultimately scrapped[20][21][22][23][24][25] and its code was reused to make the End, which can be seen in versions prior to 14w17a as the End\'s technical biome was still referred to in the debug menu as "Sky".', 'Unlike the Sky Dimension, the End has a dark purple sky, no clouds, and the floating islands are made entirely of end stone.', 'With the addition of the Buffet functionality in Java Edition 1.13 snapshot 18w15a, this can be distantly recreated by using the "Floating Islands" option. The addition of custom world generation in Java Edition 1.16.2 snapshot 20w28a also included a minecraft:floating_islands noise preset offering similar functionality.', 'These features were mentioned at one point, but later abandoned or their current status is unknown. Note that some of these features were mentioned by developers who either no longer work at Mojang Studios, or no longer work on Minecraft.', 'There have been several cases of mobs being mentioned by developers as potential candidates for being added to the game.', 'Notch revealed during the 8th Seecret Friday Update that he was planning to add dragons.[26] Later, he mentioned dragons again during MINECON 2010.[27]', 'On October 12th, 2011, he announced on Twitter that after the addition of the Ender Dragon, he was planning to add "slightly less dangerous" red dragons, which would be able to land and wouldn\'t destroy terrain.[28]', 'Dragons were originally planned for the Overworld.', 'In a Reddit thread on the same day, when questioned about how Ender Dragons phase through blocks, Notch went on record saying that "less overpowered" red dragons in the Overworld that wouldn\'t go through terrain would eventually be added.[29][30] However, the red dragon has not subsequently been added.', 'Jeb informed participants of his AMA on Reddit that he would add red dragons, but was unsure exactly how.[31]', 'On October 22, 2013, Dinnerbone tweeted that the red dragon is "shelved" and not in development.', '', 'It was never promised, we have no plans to add a red dragon at this time.', 'Later, on December 15, 2013, a Dinnerbone post on Reddit indicated his belief that red dragons likely will be implemented at some point:', '', "I'm sure one day there will be. Not right now though.", 'Three creatures were present in the MINECON Earth 2017 vote. One was a sea creature known as as "Mob A", "The Monster of the Ocean Depths", or the Barnacle. It would have spawned in deep water and attacked players with a tentacle-like tongue to pull players down and drown them.', 'Another was "Mob C, The Great Hunger." It would have had a large mouth capable of removing enchantments from items and would have camouflaged itself by entering the ground with its mouth open upward. Jeb mentioned that the mob wouldn\'t have been aggressive, only damaging the player if they accidentally fell into its mouth, and it wouldn\'t have stripped enchantments from players\' items unless players fed it intentionally.[34] Its functionality was eventually replaced by the Grindstone.', 'The other mob was "Mob D, The Hovering Inferno." It would have looked like a large blaze with shields instead of rods, and would have spawned with groups of blazes in the nether. This mob however appears in the Minecraft Dungeons DLC Flames of the Nether and the board game portal dash under the name "Wildfire".', 'Mob B, the Monster of the Night Skies, was the Phantom, which won the vote and has been added.[35]', 'Mob A, Monster of the Ocean Depths.', 'Mob C, the Great Hunger.', 'Mob D, the Hovering Inferno.', 'In September 2018, a poll was held in which Chinese users could vote on which "national treasure" they thought would be added to Minecraft, to promote the release of Minecraft China. There were five options: giant panda, Chinese alligator, snub-nosed monkey, white-lipped deer, or baiji.[36] The panda received the most votes and was the one added into the game. It was later stated on Minecraft Feedback[37] that alligators and/or crocodiles, if implemented into the game, would likely not be hostile mobs as, like the shark (which was outright rejected), hostile mobs had to be fantasy creatures. It is unknown whether any of these mobs will be added.', 'Chinese alligator.', 'Snub-nosed monkey.', 'White-lipped deer.', 'Baiji.', 'In MINECON Earth 2018, a biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: Desert, Savanna, or Taiga. The taiga won the vote and would be the first biome to be updated. The Taiga included the Fox, while the Desert will one day include the  Meerkat, and the Savanna will include the Ostrich and the Termite. There has been no information as to when the Desert and Savanna will be updated.', 'Meerkat.', 'Ostrich.', 'Termite.', 'In MINECON Live 2019, another biome vote was held between which biome should be the priority to update next. The updated biomes would also come with brand new mobs. There were three options: Badlands, Swamp, or Mountains. The Mountains won the vote and would be the first biome to be updated. The Mountains included the Goat, and the Swamp included the Frog, while the Badlands will one day include the Vulture. The Goat was added in 1.17, while the Frog was added in 1.19. There has been no information as to when the Badlands will be updated.', 'Vulture.', 'In Minecraft Live 2020, a mob vote was held between which mob should be added to the game next. There were three options: Moobloom, Iceologer, or Glow Squid. The Glow Squid won the vote and was added into the game in the Caves & Cliffs: Part I update. Jens has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if, or when, they fit and can be prioritized.[38]', 'Moobloom.', 'Iceologer.', 'In Minecraft Live 2021, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: Glare, Allay, or Copper Golem. The Allay won the vote and was added to the game in the Wild Update. Jens has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if or when they fit and can be prioritized.[38]', 'Glare.', 'Copper Golem.', 'In Minecraft Live 2022, another mob vote was held to determine which new mob should be added to the game. There were three options: Sniffer, Rascal, or Tuff Golem. The Sniffer won the vote. Jens has mentioned that the team will add the losing mobs if or when they fit and can be prioritized.[38]', 'Rascal.', 'Tuff Golem.', 'The original Pigman texture.', 'Development of a male mob which may have had no clothes was also mentioned by Dinnerbone in 2012,[39][40][41] but this is not currently being worked on. On April 14, 2020, Dinnerbone clarified that the mob was going to be a pigman bodyguard, which was naked by default so that the player could provide armor for it.[42]', 'In 2012, Jon Kågström mentioned fish, birds, and other tree animals, to "make the game seem more alive".[43] Parrots and four different fish mobs were added in 2017 and 2018, respectively.', 'Notch mentioned prefix mobs in a Brocraft stream. He gave examples of mobs such as "Burning Spiders, Giant Zombies, and Cobble Creepers." Some prefix mobs have been added in the form of cave spiders, charged creepers, strays, husks, drowned, and other mob variants. Giant zombies have technically been added, but are currently unused. In the 3D Shareware April Fools update, the ORDER.txt jokingly mentions "11 new enemy variants including Buff Crepper and Evilshroom II" for a fake game: "MineCraft 3D: Deeper and darker."', 'Before the implementation of hostile mobs, Notch stated that he liked the idea of monsters such as lava zombies or troll infestations which would roam the land and break things. Later, the zombie was implemented.[44]', 'Reindeer were another mob acknowledged and suggested initially for Christmas 2015.[45] Minecraft Earth version 0.6.0 added the Jolly Llama, which is supposed to represent a reindeer. It is currently unknown if reindeer will one day be added to Minecraft or not.', "A mob which camouflages with its environment was a concept considered by Jeb when designing the Shulker, which was originally one of the mob's mechanics during development - the mob would camouflage with the surroundings, but due to difficulties with the code and rendering, he decided to abandon this element of the mob. He stated however that it may happen in the future.[46]", 'In 2017, a jocular suggestion regarding adding more types of Illagers was posted. One of them, the Pillager, has been implemented in Java Edition 1.14. In Minecraft Dungeons, there is a mob known as the Iceologer, known internally as the Chillager. This mob was also part of the 2020 mob vote.[47][48][49][50]', 'Notch commented that sea monsters were a possibility on Minecast on July 21, 2010.[citation\xa0needed] He particularly noted the possibility of sharks, though Mojang has since then denied that they will be added. Hostile aquatic mobs like the guardian and drowned have been added since then. A more recent developer hinted about adding mobs involved adding seals/sea lions and/or orcas.[51] This may be related to dolphins, which were added about a month later in 18w15a.', "Soul Fire Blazes were talked about by Jeb. He stated that he doesn't want to make another mob variant, but that it would be interesting to make a mob connected to soul fire.[52]", "Snails were talked about by Xilefian. He'd make them a cube the shape & size of a player head, like a mini Shulker with no foot or head, just the shell is visible and it will have solid collision and will require a pickaxe to mine. They only move when no players are looking at them, to give them the sense of moving slowly. When they do move it is 1 block at a time. They spawn in humid biomes when it rains at nighttime. If cooked on campfires then eat them you have a chance to gain a nautilus shell and possibly a 0.0001% chance of a Shulker shell. Dye their shells, race them and they potentially follow the paths of mossy blocks but you still have to look away for them to move. If given a book and if all players go to bed then when morning arrives the book is randomly delivered by the snail to another player. Maybe it lets you deliver an item to your base each time you sleep. If a splash potion of speed is thrown on them they move a little bit further when you look away. [53]", 'Loops were unused sounds, found in the game files, and were possibly meant for when the player is in a specific type of location (i.e., in caves, forests, the ocean and beside a waterfall).', 'Image from Dinnerbone of a fallen tree.', "Several features regarding trees have been mentioned throughout the game's history.", 'Notch mentioned branches in a blog post during Indev. The addition of sideways logs seems to be an alternative for branches.[54] Implemented on chorus trees and acacia trees, but not on ordinary trees.', 'The implementation of fallen trees (like those currently in Bedrock Edition)[55] has also been brought up, but appears to never have been actually undertaken beyond this mention in Java Edition. In Minecraft Live 2021, a fallen tree was present in a concept art of a birch forest.', "Two tree species were mentioned at the biome vote for MINECON 2018 called the palm and baobab. However, both trees' host biomes were voted against and the trees have yet to appear in game despite being promised implementation later.", 'Many features relating to the underground and caves have been mentioned historically, but are yet to be seen in-game. Some suggestions which were approved by Mojang include rainbow crystalline caves[56] and cave maps, considered "an interesting idea" by Notch.[57] 1.13 added buffet worlds, which has an option for cave-like generation.', 'More ores and cave types was a general target proposed by Dinnerbone in late 2013.[58] Since this post, flooded underwater caves have been implemented, along with 1.16 adding Ancient Debris and Nether Gold Ore, and 1.17 adding Copper Ore and Amethyst Crystals.', 'In Minecraft Live 2020, Caves & Cliffs update was announced, bringing more new types of caves.', 'Notch mentioned on his blog, The Word of Notch, that friends lists would be added after Beta 1.8.[59] The Minecraft documentary team of 2 Player Productions filmed a Keynote roadmap, containing these lines.[60][61] Kristoffer mentioned on Twitter that he is currently working on friends lists for Scrolls, then for other Mojang games. These will be available for players with Mojang accounts. At MineCon 2012, Jeb stated that it would be a large implementation on the server-side and will be used for all Mojang games, and that is a big project.[62][63] With the release of 1.16.4, the social interactions menu functions somewhat like a friends menu but not exactly, but the Xbox account system currently used on Bedrock and Java has a friends system.', "An inventory rewrite was originally added in the snapshot 14w07a for Java Edition 1.8, but a roadblock was hit and Mojang had to shelve the change before the release of 1.8.[64] Other changes to the inventory have been mentioned, including spectators can now look at people's inventory, visible health/armor bar on all players,[65] seeing players' GUI when spectating from their POV[66] and the return of shift-double-clicking.[67][68]", 'Lua Scripting was a feature mentioned by Notch as a way to create server-side modifications.[69] The server would be able to create custom commands, assign certain server functions to blocks, and create user groups. Players would not have to download scripts within or outside of the client, and therefore no client-side modifications will be necessary. Notch said that he wanted Lua to be an extension for Minecraft, but did not want Lua to turn Minecraft into a game engine.', 'Lua scripting has been further hinted at by Searge.[13]', 'Certain plugins such as Spigot or Bukkit support Lua scripting implementation into servers, however these plugins are not created by nor affiliated with Mojang Studios and thus are not an official means in which to implement Lua scripting.', 'Multiple features relating to the Nether have been proposed and acknowledged, such as utilizing the space above the Nether ceiling for something else,[70] non-rectangular nether portals,[71] and nether portals placing players in front if possible.[72]', 'During the development of the Nether Update, other ideas were discussed, such as dyeable nether portals, which were dismissed as not being priority by Jeb.[73] As a joke feature in Java Edition 20w14∞, funky portals were added and would change color depending on the text data found in a Written Book.', 'Dinnerbone said on Twitter he would like to add weapons/tools that cannot be crafted, and could only obtained through treasure chests/trading, etc. For example, bows with faster drawback (somewhat implemented with the addition of Quick Charge), boots that increase health, or night vision helmets. However, the attribute system has to be finished first.[74][75][76][77]', 'Frost Walker and Mending were implemented as treasure enchantments in 1.9 as well as the Curses of Binding and Vanishing in 1.11, and tridents have been implemented in 1.13 as drowned-exclusive weapons, somewhat implementing this feature. In 1.16, treasure enchantments have also been made less accessible (therefore more rare) via nerfing AFK fishing, and the new Soul Speed enchantment is exclusively obtainable through Piglin bartering.', 'Grum mentioned that there may be easier customization of chat and sheep colors.[78]', 'Since 1.16, the "color" tag in raw NBT text has been able to accept hexadecimal colors:', 'Ryan Holtz stated that he wanted to improve the rendering system to allow for customizable models and animations.[79][80] Dinnerbone later stated that player models would not be able to be changed.[81]', 'Dinnerbone mentioned on Twitter that he was experimenting with adding seasons, and varying the length of day and night according to season. He also mentioned it during MineCon 2013.[82][83] Seasons may include changes in color of tree leaves and may also be tied to real time.[84][85] The later released Minecraft Dungeons has a location called Pumpkin Pastures, which resembles an autumn-themed forest biome.', 'Spikes received a mention in mid-2009 by Notch in a blog post.[86] These were originally planned for Java Edition Beta 1.7,[citation\xa0needed] working by extending and retracting spikes (and making them more "spike pistons" than anything),[citation\xa0needed] but were replaced by sticky pistons.[citation\xa0needed] On May 28, 2012, Dinnerbone stated that he\'d like to add spike blocks, but is unsure of how to implement them.[87]', 'The 1.17 update implemented Pointed Dripstone, which can damage mobs and players that fall on them, or are crushed by them.', "Multiple references to steel were made early on in the game's development. Notch had stated that it could be made using coal and iron ore,[86] and that it could be used for armor and weapons more powerful than iron.[88] In-game, flint and steel is crafted using iron ingots, considering the lack of steel and the need of a “fire striker”, despite the name of the former.", 'The Plugin API,[89][90] dubbed "Workbench", is a feature that allows mod developers to easily add more content to the game. In contrast to mods, plugins will not require any alteration of the minecraft.jar file itself, although they will also be slightly limited in their feature set.[91][92] The Bukkit team will help make the official Plugin API.[93]', 'Changes with the off-hand slot added in Java Edition 1.9 were planned on being added to Minecraft sometime in the future.[94] Specifically, the player would no longer be able to attack or place blocks with any item in their off-hand slot, similar to Bedrock Edition. However, players would still be able to hold items in the off-hand slot, which still made the off-hand useful for maps and such. Also, blocking would still be able to be activated if the player is holding a shield in their off-hand. However, this regression was later retracted due to massive community backlash.', "This refers to changing the chunk format to make chunks 16 blocks tall, allowing for infinite world height. Ryan Holtz discussed it with Erik Broes, but they decided they couldn't implement it, because of the difficulty of solving problems such as the occlusion of sky light.[95] The feature was previously rejected by Notch for similar reasons.[96]", "These features were briefly mentioned, but no further information was given after it's mention.", 'Snapshot 12marc40awesome, a joke snapshot by Marc Watson.', 'Skis texture.', 'Notch and Mojang Studios employees have frequently joked about adding various features to the game.', 'The changelog for the April Fools update Minecraft 2.0 contained numerous features that were not actually included.[218] Despite the changelog being part of the joke, many of these features have since been implemented into the game.', 'The changelog:']

 BODY: ['An Easter egg is an intentional hidden message, inside joke, or feature in a work such as a computer program, web page, video game, television program, movie, book or any other form of media. Minecraft features several Easter eggs hidden in the game.', 'Between October 20 and November 3, bats can spawn at a light level of 6 or less instead of the normal light level 3 or less.', "On October 31, zombies, zombie villagers, husks, drowned, skeletons, strays, zombified piglins, and wither skeletons may sometimes wear carved pumpkins or jack o'lanterns on their heads. These mobs would drop these blocks if killed using a tool enchanted with Looting.

Spooky!" splash.', 'From December 24–26, chests, large chests, and trapped chests have their textures changed to Christmas chests that resemble wrapped Christmas presents. This was added in Java Edition 1.4.6 for Christmas 2012. A texture file called "skis.png" was also added in Java Edition 1.4.6 in the same folder as the Christmas chests, but it was added by Dinnerbone as a red herring. This was re-added for Christmas 2013,[1] along with a new "rain feature"—pigs riding chickens (this is not planned to be fully implemented).

Thus, the same seed generates the same terrain every time.', "A world's seed is set when that world is created. By default, it is decided automatically, but it can also be set manually.

If the seed or generator changes in a saved world, new chunks are based on the new seed and no longer match those from the old seed.

In fact, deleting chunks is sometimes done to let newly-introduced features appear in an old world; see Tutorials/Updating old oceans in 1.13 using MCEdit.', 'Because seeds are simply random values read into an algorithm and not actually names of different worlds, using a certain seed does not result in a world with any relevance to the value of that seed.

Since it no longer comprised all implementations for all consoles, the term was amended.', "On September 20, 2017, the Xbox One Edition was withdrawn from the Microsoft Store, in conjunction with Bedrock Edition's Better Together Update. People who owned it were entitled to download the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft for free. Worlds and DLC were intended to be transferable to Bedrock Edition, however some DLC does not carry over. Users can also continue to play on the Xbox One Edition instead. This also happened with the Nintendo Switch Edition on June 21, 2018, and PlayStation 4 Edition on December 10, 2019.[15][16] Again, some DLC does not transfer on these platforms.", 'Initially, Xbox One Edition was planned to no longer receive updates, starting with the lack of an equivalent update to TU58, but the edition later received CU50, an update adding the MINECON Earth Skin Pack, and later updates resumed entirely with CU51, an update equivalent to TU60, which also added all the features from TU58.', 'On May 3, 2018, Mojang officially announced that the Xbox 360 Edition, PlayStation 3 Edition, PlayStation Vita Edition, and Wii U Edition would receive the Update Aquatic, but would receive no further feature updates after its release. The Xbox One Edition and Nintendo Switch Edition were excluded from Update Aquatic. The PlayStation 4 Edition would still receive feature updates until December 10, 2019 (including Update Aquatic and Village & Pillage), when it was replaced with Bedrock Edition on the platform, at which point the Legacy Console Edition codebase was discontinued entirely.[16][17] Despite being discontinued, Xbox One Edition and PlayStation 4 Edition are playable on the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 respectively via backward compatibility.[18]', 'Although worlds can still be transferred from Xbox 360 Edition and Wii U Edition to Xbox One Edition and Nintendo Switch Edition respectively, the worlds currently cannot be loaded on the latter consoles due to the Xbox 360 Edition and Wii U Edition using a newer version of the game. As of April 15, 2020, the ability to transfer worlds from PlayStation 3 Edition and PlayStation Vita Edition to PlayStation 4 Edition has been terminated.', 'By the end of 2020, all Legacy Console Edition games had ceased receiving new updates.', 'In-game screenshot of Xbox 360 Edition', 'The objective of the game remains the same as its Java and Bedrock editions counterparts, where players can build virtual realities in a sandbox-like environment. There is no preset goal; the player may choose to set their own goals.', 'For the most part, Legacy Console Edition is almost identical to Java Edition with few apparent differences,[19] but was released with the Xbox 360 Edition in an earlier version equivalent to Java Edition Beta 1.6.6, rather than the current Java Edition version at the time of release, 1.2.5. The Wii U Edition was released with an earlier version equivalent to Java Edition 1.6.4, rather than the current Java Edition version at the time of release, 1.8.9. Legacy Console also slowly became more like Bedrock (like movable tile entities being implemented) to prepare for Legacy Console being taken off the market.', 'Differences from Java and Bedrock editions include:', 'The different gameplay modes and settings may vary from the other platform versions, such as hardcore mode, as it is currently one of many Java Edition exclusive features.', 'Using Creative mode permanently disables achievements/trophies and leaderboard updates during normal gameplay on that world, however the core mechanics of flight and infinite resources remain the same.', 'Blocks can be destroyed by the proper tools and depending on the block, the quality of the tool. Example: Wool blocks can be destroyed by using Shears. While only Iron Pickaxe  and higher can break and gather Gold Ore blocks.', 'In Survival mode:', 'At the edges of the world, which varies depending on the console and world size, there exists an invisible barrier that cannot be bypassed (not even in Creative Mode). Below sea level, the barrier is comprised of gravel. During TU 46, it was possible using a glitch involving the new Boats to bypass this barrier. Past this barrier, an ocean with a flat stone sea floor generates up until X/Z 2800 in which blocks stop rendering although the physics still exist.', 'Legacy Console Edition logo']
